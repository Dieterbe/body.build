## Notes on how to construct meal plans

these will help when writing the code to auto-make meal plans.  Although there's so many different ways to go about it, we should probably just support a coach (or individual) to do it themselves using whichever method they prefer.

### Macros

* protein: need 1.6g/kg,  1.8 to be really sure or 2.2 per day (for concurrent athletes, people with muscle memory, or AAS users). vegans/vegetarians need more too due to suboptimal amino acid profiles. can use minima per meal, and ratios based on PSMF. each meal >=0.4g/kg protein for leucine threshold. during anabolic window, especially for advanced trainees and especially last meal of the day, can go up to 0.8 g/kg
* fats: we need our 20-40% per day. can either be 0 fats outside of anabolic window, or everything pro-rata
per course: you can generally set protein, fat and fiber intakes as minima rather than set targets

MPS (anabolic window):
* can span across nights into next day(s).
* beginners: multiple days
* trained individuals generally have an anabolic window that peaks within 24 hours.
-> consume a disproportionate amount of daily protein requirement in the period between workout and bedtime. Itâ€™s likely advisable to have at least 2 meals during this period, or else to have an early meal the next day. 

Protein synching:
- mainly for trained individuals, and mainly when bulking. in other cases, less important. and even so, any synching h minor effect

General rule:
surround workouts by 2 meals with <=5 hours in between them and together those meals should have at least 0.8 g/kg protein (based on the research in bodybuilders from Mori and Cribb & Hayes).
Within the framework of 0.4g/kg per meal, can bias protein intake to post-workout meals. especially meals preceeding a long fast (e.g. sleep).
 
calorie cycling probably best for most.
PSMF, specifically for overweight individuals. (it can be quite aggressive for leaner individuals)
kcal min 9.7*protein per day

calorie cycling with PSMF is at worst, equally good as isocaliric, at best, better. (mainly for adherence, i believe)
likewise, ad libitum diets can be a very simple and effective way to diet. (it works great for Dieter)
