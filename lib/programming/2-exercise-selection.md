## principles
### iso & compound equally effective. but compound burns more cals, saves time, cardio, and more carry-over strength. iso more for filling in gaps and reaching volume
### 1) limit factor
#### grip
#### bi-articulate may reduce involvement
##### hams
* during squats, hams grow 20% as quads. due to knee flexion moment
  squats only target quads and glutes
##### rectus femoris
* little activation during squat due to hip flexion moment
* but leg extensions work well (lean back 45 degrees otherwise active insuficiency)
##### gastroc
* passive and active insufficiences when short or long
* during squats and leg presses, to bring back knees, you need plantar flexion, but this comes with knee flexion moment, so gastros mostly inactive
* gastros is active however during deadlifts and good mornings
-> rule of thumb, count half of DL volume towards gastrocs
##### triceps
* long head is weak shoulder extensor
* during pulling exercises like chin-ups, pulldowns, not very active due to its elbow extension moment
* however, very wide grip lets it help with shoulder extension without interfering at elbow
* volume only really counts when you keep your arms straight, e.g. straight arm pull-over (long head)
* during pushing, long head shoulder extension moment may interfere
  - if limited by elbow extension, triceps long head helps
  - if limited by shoulder flexion, not so much
  rule of thumb, count barbell presses as 50% and add isolation work
  lat prayers (straight arm pull-over) counts as long head volume
##### biceps
* weak shoulder flexion moment up to 60degr (stops when elbow at shoulder height)
* count overhead pulls with full ROM as volume for bicep, but add an isolation with arm at the side, because bicep weakens when shortened
* pulling exercises without full biceps ROM and under 90 deg shoulder flexion -> count half
* don't actively pronate during contraction (bicep is supinator)

#### unstable surface
* it takes a large amount of instability to make an exercise less effective to stimulate the target, but can help with core and rehab (higher activation for lower loads), which moves the limit factor
* split squats and back squats similar activation in vastus lateralis, biceps femoris, glute max and erector spinae (it's stable enough)

#### dumbell vs barbell
mostly equivalent, but consider ROM
##### triceps
- using a bar (barbell press and overhead press) triceps can contribute more (pushing the bar apart), but need narrow grip (hands within elbows)
- triceps don't really contribute to dumbell presses (you don't extend your elbows)
- dumbell press counts 50% towards tri's compared to barbell, need to add isolation to compensate
##### biceps
- dumbell rows only stimulate 50% compared to isolation or fixed bar pulls
- extremely wide grip bar pulls may stimulate biceps more, due to horizontal force production (and lower flexion demands)

### 2) eccentric contractions
eccentric is 20% stronger and allows to do more work, but needs special equipment. concentric-eccentric cycles are great too.
poor research shows isometrics probably inferior, but at long length they can produce more growth

### 3) stretch mediated hypertrophy
high tension at long lengths (but no need for max len or max tension at such len), and do full ROM

### 4) tissue stress distribution
don't pull on tendons more than necessary.
* pull down to chest > pull down behind head (for lats)
* press in front of body > behind the body presses 
* dips shoulder position

freedom of movement. some machines can be restrictive, which can be good when injured

open vs closed kinetic chain
closed = you move
open = object moves
closed tends to be slightly more natural/effective and important re: injuries, but more important is to consider symptoms

### 5) unilateral > bilateral
motor cortex can recruit more muscle when unilateral. when all else equal (e.g. not introducing new balance requirement), probably prefer unilateral.
this works best for machine/isolation

### 6) microloading
abality to load high and precisely
e.g. not push-ups for advanced
cable lateral raises are great until you get stuck

### Dieter's addition:
no active/passive insufficency

## exercises that generally score well on the principles



* customize exercise selection and the specific execution of each exercise to the trainee’s anthropometry, injury risk, available equipment and goals
* When you perform multiple exercises for a muscle group, as should often be the case (discussed in the next section), make sure the total program’s exercise selection has synergy rather than excessive overlap.
* The exercises are categorized roughly in terms of target musculature from a practical programming perspective. Later in this module we’ll go into detail on how to count exercise volume per muscle group.

## exercise variety

- regional activation is real. e.g. lunges not great for hams as a whole, but they do hit proximal part of long head of biceps femoris
- cover all major muscle functions. For the trapezius, for example, you want at least 1 exercise involving scapular elevation, depression and retraction.  e.g. wide shrugs (elevation), reverse flys (retraction) and lat pulldowns (depression), 

- beginners: as few exercises to cover all muscle fibers, even compounds work
- more advanced >=1 exercise per function
- advanced: more volume, so more different exercises (dieter note: helps against joint/tendon overuse)
beyond that, switch up over time, not in same workouts

multiple exercises: stress different fibers or at different lengths

pec major:
a single flat press / fly, other functions will work with vertical presses and pulls

Trapezius Make sure each head (lower/middle/upper) is targeted. The middle and lower heads often get worked well with vertical pulls already. Deadlifts and overhead presses stimulate the upper head, but for maximum growth, adding a wide or overhead shrug is advisable

Deltoids Make sure each head (anterior/lateral/posterior) is targeted. The front head rarely ever needs isolation work, as it is stimulated by all horizontal and vertical presses, so it’s more likely to be overworked than understimulated. The lateral head needs a lateral raise or overhead press variant to emphasize shoulder abduction rather than flexion. During overhead pressing, you should keep your elbows out to the sides to emphasize the lateral delt instead of the front delt. A relatively wide grip makes this easier. Even better arguably, dumbbells activate the lateral delts more effectively than a barbell for most people. Standing also activates the sides of the shoulders better than sitting, as with sitting you often end up with a high-incline press. Plus, the bench restricts your natural scapular movement. The posterior head is effectively trained with most pulling movements, but many of these don’t achieve full ROM, so an added reverse fly or high row variant is advisable

Latissimus dorsi
Due to the wide variation in muscle fiber angles, at least two different angle pulling
exercises are recommended for the lats for non-novice trainees: one emphasizing
shoulder extension and one emphasizing adduction, such as close-grip chin-ups and
wide-grip pull-ups.
Biceps brachii
A single isolation exercise with the elbow kept at the side should suffice, assuming the
program already has other pulling movements involving the biceps.
Triceps brachii
An isolation exercise for the long head is generally desirable. The lateral and medial
head get sufficient stimulation from (horizontal) presses.
Quadriceps
While having little functional differentiation, a leg extension exercise is recommended in
addition to a squatting movement to overload the quadriceps in full contraction and
stimulate the rectus femoris.
Hamstrings
You need at least a knee flexion exercise, like a leg curl, and a hip extension exercise,
like a Romanian deadlift, to stimulate all hamstring heads well along their full length.
Gluteus maximus (and medius)
Due to its large amount of muscle fibers with slight differences in angle, at least one
bent-knee and one straight-leg hip extension exercise are recommended, such as hip
thrusts and Romanian deadlifts. A hip abduction exercise is also advisable for maximum growth of the gluteus medius, though anti-adduction force during squats, especially
unilateral squats, may suffice

Calves
You need at least one straight-leg plantarflexion (calf raise) exercise in addition to one
bent-knee plantarflexion (seated calf raise) exercise for the soleus.

Erector spinae
Squats and deadlifts often suffice in practice, but if injury risk is low and maximum
growth is desired, a dedicated high-rep back extension exercise can be added

## assigning volume

- ignore warm-up sets.
- starting point: count agonists (targets) and synergists
- better: fractional volumes, based on:
  * the criteria, especially the limit factor
  * neuromuscular fatigue caused
rows 50% to biceps
deadlifts 100% erector spinae even if only stabilizer
quads 50% in deadlifts

depends on form. maybe just do 50-75-100 and ignore everything <40-60


do you see any value in training spine lateral flexion (e.g. side bends on hyper extension) -> not really, just for waist thickening
