considerations:

step 1: measure or estimate 1RM using Epley/Welday formula: Epley estimated 1RM = weight × (1 + repetitions / 30)

step 2: determine intensity: percentage of 1RM
    hypertrophy: reps 5-30, which tends to be around. 30-85% (assuming close to failure) (6-12 reps is a brosience myth)
    low rep: train for 1RM strength & isometric strength, high rep: train for endurance strength (once you are > beginner), more fatigue // only relevant for trained people
    >70%1RM -> tendon stronger, injury risk <->low rep, joint sparing, injury accommodating
    do both high rep and low rep for more gains. either same workout, or other workouts
    untrained: no need for high&low. little gain >60%, -> 60%
    >novice: high&low, 70%, let's say 60 to 70%
    intermediate: 65-80
    advanced: high&low, --> 70 - 85-90% 
    
high intensity better suited for compound/multi-joint due to cardio/fatigue
low intensity for isolation for injury/technique

// advanced techniques for later: couple of weeks strength focused, then lower intensity -> bigger overall gains

* prefer to spread sessions over the week, to reduce fatigue and support more volume.
* prefer to spread out volume in multiple high-frequency sessions, improves recovery
* don't do a majority of high rep sets in a workout, as it's too fatigueing

// step X ? rep targets: maybe not really a step. could be part of the routine.
// given 1RM + desired intensity targets, use muscle-specific hypertrophy method (but that already requires a whole program) or lookup table to come up with rep targets

for women, use muscle-specific hypertrophy method because they can do more reps

// step 4: determine volume: number of sets per week per muscle group
hypertrophy: positive growth up to at least 10 sets per week per muscle group, if not 20-30. but also possible reduction of results starting at 20.
strength: tapers off well before 10 sets per week per exercise, but not much data, hence probably need different exercises
Based on the above meta-analyses and theory, we can roughly say that for many people, the optimal training volume is somewhere in the range of 10 to 20 sets per muscle group per week. However, these numbers are based on averages from the total literature

Based on all the data, novice trainees can likely maximize their gains with around 6-10 sets per muscle group per week, whereas trained individuals generally need 12-20 sets, sometimes more

women or young -> can do more

20-33% reduction in volume is generally appropriate during a cut compared to during a bulk (though at end of bulk, may have become advanced enough to eat the diff)
see volume calculator https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Jc4ZpWSjq8Y8tHS29sijzz20Rvk-hsbE/edit?gid=1727367196#gid=1727367196

The calculator considers only the listed factors, so if there are other factors at play that likely influence someone’s volume tolerance, such as performance enhancing drugs or elite genetics, you’ll have to account for that manually. The calculator assumes that your program design in terms of proximity to failure, diet set-up, rest intervals and training frequency is in line with the course recommendations. If that’s not the case, you’ll have to adjust it accordingly

do more volume in follicular phase, and less in luteal phase. e.g. +- 33%
(adjust volume over time, via AVT or tracking work capacity)

// step 5: training frequency

In conclusion, most lifters should be able to maintain muscle mass and strength on a single full-body workout per week. Novice lifters can generally get away with just a single hard set per muscle group, but more advanced lifters will often need to perform multiple sets per muscle group. When performed to momentary muscle failure, this can even stimulate muscle growth up to a certain level, but the minimum effective volume to make long-term progress for advanced lifters is likely at least 4 sets per week. To make such low training volumes effective, very high effort per set is necessary, generally involving training to muscle failure. The exact minimum effective volume is individual just like the optimum training volume. Certainly not everyone will be able to maximize their muscle growth on low-volume training

In conclusion, the research suggest that productive training volume is limited to 6-10 sets per muscle group per workout. The exact optimal volume likely depends on the specifics of the training program, in particular how close to failure you’re training, the rest intervals and individual factors like genetics

Benefits of higher training frequencies are found mostly in more advanced trainees on higher training volumes. In untrained individuals, there are only a few studies finding significant benefits of training a muscle more than once per week and none found improved muscle growth. In trained individuals, there are several studies finding significant benefits of training a muscle more than twice per week. The highest beneficial training frequencies are all found in advanced lifters on high training volumes. This trend aligns with the theory that as you get more advanced, your anabolic window shortens, there is less protein breakdown during training and you become more resistant to muscle damage and neuromuscular fatigue. Trained muscles may therefore benefit from a higher total training load and frequency of exercise

Another large practical benefit of higher training frequencies and full-body workouts is that they can save you a ton of time, because they allow you to train non-overlapping muscle groups while other muscles are resting. We’ll cover this in greater detail in the module on exercise ordering

re: injury
When the primary goal is muscle growth, however, it is generally advisable to restrict the frequency per exercise to twice a week. Further increases in training frequency per muscle group are best achieved by incorporating more different exercises rather than performing the same exercise more often.

// step 6: split
When you’ve determined your training frequency in all 3 ways – how often you work out,
how often you train each muscle and how often you perform each exercise – this largely
determines your training split

If you have unequal numbers of rest days in your training split, perform your most strenuous workouts before those rest days to make optimal use of that extra recovery time.• To maximize whole-body muscular development, spread your sessions across the week as equally as possible.• If some of your workouts are easier than others, perform your most important workouts (training priority exercises or muscle groups) after those easier sessions so that you’re relatively unfatigued.

// make adjustments over time for work capacity. strength process vs fatigue index

// TAKE HOME

For maximum muscle growth, a training program should have the following parameters.
• Training intensity: 30-90% of 1RM, ideally with the muscle-specific hypertrophy method and higher intensities for compound exercises.
• Training volume: generally in between 10-30 sets per week per muscle group based on someone’s recovery capacity.
• Training frequency: at least once per week for every 6 sets of training volume per muscle, increasing up to daily or even bidaily training as training volume and training advancement increase. In practice, many trained individuals can make each workout a full-body training session.
• Your training split should logically follow from your optimized training frequencies and volume, not the other way around. Make the training split fit your optimized parameters for each muscle group and then configure it to maximize the total weekly training volume load
