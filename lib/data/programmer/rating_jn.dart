0:00 - What makes an exercise S tier?
// COMPOUNDS
0:46 - Hex Press 1/7 - no pec stretch, no tension. triceps take over. F
1:09 - Plate Press - - no pec stretch, no tension. triceps take over, more awkward, not overloadable 0/7
1:17 - Dumbbell Pullover 2/7 (rating is for pecs!), people don't seem to feel it. much better lat exercise
6:30 - Banded Push-Ups - adds tesnion at top half only 3/7
7:01 - Plyometric Push-Ups - not much tension or stretch 2/7
7:27 - Guillotine Press - shrug shoulders out, flare elbows out. barbell to neck. more pec stretch (needs to feel comfortable!), potential danger 1/7
8:49 - Dumbbell Guillotine Press - same, and safe! 5/7
9:09 - 1-Arm Dumbbell Press - unstable, waste of time. disperses tension. 1/7
9:28 - Smith Machine Flat Bench Press - same upsides as standard BB, can push a bit more. 5/7
9:46 - Incline Smith Machine Press - same, but bit more upper pecs 5/7
// ISOLATIONS
10:14 - Cable Crossovers - big stretch, even tension across ROM. limited in weight when you're strong. cable pulls you back / less stable. .5/7
10:49 - Seated Cable Pec Flye - same, but no stability issue. jeff's favorite chest isolation. 6/7
12:13 - Cable Press-Around - full contraction (for occassional short length work) 5/7
12:43 - Cross-Body Standing Dumbbell Flye - full contraction. basically front raise for front delt. 1/7
13:09 - Floor Press - for max BP strength. great for tricep. no full stretch.  3/7

all barbell bench presses allow high tension but limited ROM/tension in deepest stretch, they're overloadable.  
not always stimulating well however.
incline variants should stimulate a bit more upper pecs (while keeping the same mid/lower)
Jeff gives the same rating to all flat and incline bench presses, except declines get a lower rating because they don't recruit upper pecs well and allow for less ROM.

Dumbbell presses allow deeper stretch than BB. less commonly injurious.  
Overloadable but may run into dumbbell limits when you're very strong.
Similar to barbell presses: the incline variants may allow more upper pec growth while keeping the same mid/lower pec growth.
The decline version is scored less because it stimulates the upper pecs less and is awkward to set up.

 The Best And Worst Biceps Exercises 
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNO4OtYoCYk
4:25 - DB Preacher Curl - more tension at stretched position. impossible to cheat. 6/7
5:20 - Incline Curl - worse than preachers.  lot more stretch, but again tension mainly at mid point. fast to set up and easy to do .5/7
5:34 - Lying DB Curl - huge stretch (especially near the shoulder), more tension at the bottom.  5/7
6:08 - Scott Curl - preacher with vertical arm, no tension on stretched position. worse than preachers. 3/7
6:30 - Flat Bench Curl - preacher curl but on a horizontal bench. highest tension at the stretched position 4/7
7:01 - Machine Preacher Curl - locked in. jeff does lengthened partials (supinated grip) 6/7
7:16 - Waiter Curl - gimmicky. cranks your wrists, feels awkward. overload limits. just use dumbbels instead 0/7
7:35 - Drag Curl - simultaneous shortening at elbow and lengthening at shoulder. so overall not much change (similar to hams in squats which don't grow well). so likely not a good exercise. 3/7
8:11 - Spider Curl - shortened position (not much stretch), can bump into bench. 3/7
8:31 - Chin-Ups - back probably takes over. very accessible (only need your bodyweight) 4/7
9:01 - old skool 21s - 3/7 , modified 21s 5/7

11:45 - Cheat Curl - momentum concentric, controlled eccentric 5/7
12:30 - Strict Curl - suspect that it's a bit better than cheat curls, but we don't know for sure. 5/7
14:15 - Preacher Hammer Curl 6/7
14:25 - Inverse Zottman Curl 5/7

1:28 - Combo Squat Exercises 1/6 not limiting factor
1:43 - Bosu Ball Squat - too unstable, no tension 0/7
2:01 - Barbell Back Squat - high tension when deep. best for overload. uses spinal erectors. decent RF engagement, as long as you use 1 other exercise 7/7
3:04 - Barbell Front Squat - even more tension on quads (more moment arm on knee), more strain on upper back. can be awkward for some. 5/7 (6/7 if comfortable)
4:08 - Low-Bar Squat - more glutes, less quads. but still very productive 5/7
4:36 - Hack Squat - like BB squat ,but faster and more stable 7/7
5:07 - Pendulum Squat - similar to hack squat , more natural resistance path 7/7
5:25 - Smith Machine Squat - just like bb squat, but more safe. 6/7
5:50 - 45 Degree Leg Press - can't get as deep as a squat. 5/7
6:17 -  Horizontal Leg Press - worse than 45 degree. less ROM. may max out the machine. 3/7
6:39 - Lunge - more for glutes, though it does quads also. for quads 4/7, for glutes would be 5/7 or 6/7
7:05 - Leg Extension - knee concerns debunked. can work RF, especially lean back. 5/7
8:14 - Reverse Nordic - like leg extension but without machine. 5/7
8:50 - Goblet Squat - similar to BB front squat. harder to overload 4/7
9:21  - Jump Squat - for explosive, not muscle growth. 1/7
9:34 - Bulgarian Split Squat - brutal, but work well. and prevents imbalances. 6/7
10:03 - Deadlift - "quarter squat", more for glutes and overall strength. 3/7
10:24 - Step Ups. - similarly not fun as BSQ, but less stretch and less stable. but good for glutes. 3/7
10:40 - Pistol Squat - unstable and hard to overload. great for at home. 3/7
10:56 - Sissy Squat - like reverse nordic. very challenging. but hard to load and more learning curve. might feel awkward. but super deep stretch. 4/7
