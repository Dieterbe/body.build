if back pain, can try less stressfull alternatives:

## squats in order of lubmbar spine stress
low bar back squats > high bar back squats > front squats > leg presses, hack squats and most unilateral squats

## deadlift
-> switch to a hip extension exercise with less spinal loading. Examples:
* unilateral DL's. this doesn't require changing the program elsewhere.
* pull-throughs, (cable) hip extensions, reverse hyperextensions.
