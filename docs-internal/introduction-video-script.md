Quick introduction to body.build
You can go straight to the app. There is no signup and no payment. It's completely free.

In the top left you can view and create programs.  Out of the box, there is one pre-made program
It's a full body program, with 2 alternating workouts, day A and day B, 3 workouts per week.

# volume counting

Straight out of the gate you're going to see a lot of stuff and a lot of colors.
So what's going on here?
Well, the columns are the muscle groups to train.
Each workout defines sets of exercises, and we visualize here how well these sets recruit the given muscle groups.
Darker green means higher recruitment.
So for example for this chest supported machine row it mainly recruits the rear delts and the lower and middle traps and the lats, but also a bit of biceps.
Then there's this workout analysis section at the bottom that adds up all the recruitments and shows you your set volume for each muscle.  Unlike other tools, it takes into account all volume, so also the partial volume, so for example biceps in rows are counted for half. This is why volumes tend to be higher than some other apps, but the counting is more accurate.

day B has a similar section,
and then we also have an analysis across the program as a whole.  This is an average per week, even if the program doesn't neatly correspond to a week, like in this case, because we workout 3 times per week and we alternate between A and B. so we say that both day A and day B are done 3 times in 2 weeks and it computes the stats on a per-week basis accurately.

# workouts

So let's have a look at the individual workouts.
You'll see here that we have two big combo sets defined.
The reason for that is for most people the limiting factor is how much time they have for training
One of the tricks to optimize time is to program exercises that you can do in a quick succession without
much rest as long as you hit different muscles that do not overlap.

So here we define a bunch of sets to cover most of the muscles, we group them into combosets and we also paid attention to which equipment is used so you're not constantly running from one side of the gym to the other. Like this comboset here has exercises that all use dumbbells.

# modifiers & cues

Another way that sets body.build apart from other apps is the many ways to tweak the form of an exercise, which is helpful
to advanced users who want to really finetune their program or experiment with different cues and modifications to an exercise.

So let's have a better look at, for example, the seated leg extension machine.  Let's click on the settings menu.

There's basically two things here.
There's modifiers and there's cues.

Modifiers are variations that are pretty well understood and not very contentious.
Like for example, for the seated leg extension machine, if you lean back, you put more stretch on your quads and you can grow your rectus femoris better.
So if we change this value here between upright and back, you can see that it actually adjusts
the recruitment of that rectus femoris muscle. This way you can see the updated stats and really finetune your program.

If you want more information, there's a link to the study here.
There's a link to Menno Henselman's Instagram post where he talks about this.
There's a lot of links throughout the app in various places, linking to content from sports scientists and well-respected authorities in the field.

Cues on the other hand, they are often a bit more speculative, or more contentious.
Most exercises will have a cue where you can say I want to do full ROM or I want to do lengthened partials.

In this case for the leg extension specifically, there's also a cue here to pull hard on the handles,
as you may be able to get more tension on the quads.
There's a link here, Jeff Nippard explains it on his Instagram.
So if you want to learn more, you can check that out. Actually, looking at that video now, i wonder if we should add a cue for biting on your shirt, maybe that helps grow your quads too.
There's many, like fitness guys online that have their own cue tips and anecdotes, and so I think it's a good thing to put them all in the catalogue here so you can try them out in your programs and see if they improve your gains. Ideally you don't have to go scrolling through endless videos anymore for random tips, as we try to collect them all here.

# ratings

You'll see that some exercises have ratings. Some coaches on youtube publish videos where they talk about their favorite exercises or they rank them from best to worst. It's not like a strong framework, but it can help. I started adding their ratings into the database here.
This is a work in progress, but it's already a pretty useful feature.
Let's have a look at this standing cable bicep curl.
This one has a rating of 10.
Where does it come from?
Well, apparently Menno Henselmans has an article on his website where he talks about why these Bayesian curls are so good.
Basically, that's why they get a rating of 10.
But it's contingent on using this particular modifier, it needs to be a Bayesian style curl, because that's what Menno was referring to specifically.

So let's open the bicep curl here and have a look at the modifiers.
So the Bayesian here gets the rating of 10.
You can do the standard one where you face the cable stack, it only has a rating of 7.
Where does that 7 come from?
Let's have a look.
Apparently, Jeff Nippard ranked it in one of his YouTube videos here.
Let's see. You can also do different forms, Bayesian with arms behind, Bayesian with arms behind
and up.
If you want to know more, again, you just go to this particular video.
So the idea is to just collect references to wherever these sports scientists talk about
these specific exercises with specific form and give them their rating, and then those
ratings will appear here.

# analysis

So we already covered how within a workout we count up all the volume per muscle group,
and then do the same for the program as a whole.

But there's another chart here, both for the workout as well as the program, which is how
many of your sets have you defined that target a certain number of muscle groups?
So for example, here we're looking at Day B, and Day B has eight sets where you only target
one muscle group, so those are obviously your isolations, whereas all the other sets are
compounds that involve multiple muscles.
Because for most people time is a limiting factor, you want to program more compounds and
less isolations to save time because you can just target more muscles within one exercise.
So these charts are kind of a useful reminder, like hmm, that's actually quite a lot of isolations.
Maybe we can reduce the amount of total sets more by doing more compounds instead of isolations.

# help button

So if at any point something is not clear, you can always hit this help button.
The help gives you a little bit more information about how everything works.
And at the bottom there are links to the documentation of the app.
I'm still building out the docs but there's a quickstart guide for example.

# creating your own program

OK let's now have a look at defining your own program.
So let's create a test program.  At the top left we can create a program and give it a name.

You can kind of just follow the buttons that are drawing your attention.
So it will say add a workout, you add a workout, then it will ask you to add a set to the workout.
To add a set, you can either use that button or you can use any of these buttons to add a set.
Then of course you have to configure that set, choose an exercise, change which cues or modifiers
you want to use, and that's it.
But then you can also, instead of adding sets and then just choosing from this huge list
of exercises, you can also choose exercises for a specific muscle.
So for example, in this case, let's say we want to target the biceps specifically, then
we can click this button and now we can add a set for all exercises that target biceps.
And these are ordered by recruitment as well as rating.
So at the top, of course, like we saw before, we have that Bayesian standing cable bicep curl
that had the rating of 10.
The ratings will start going down, as you can see.
Recruitment also goes down, but there's many of these exercises that give you 100% recruitment.
Even like things like pull-up, for example, have very good recruitment.
But then as you start going down, you get some rows and exercises like that that won't
recruit as well.
But basically, here you have all of your varieties so you can choose the perfect exercise. # add the bicep curl
But you can, of course, always change your style again after adding the set.
So if you wanted to change it back to standard or Bayesian with arms behind and going up,
you can do that here.

# drag & drop

Another thing I wanted to show is that you can drag and drop exercises.
So let me just add some first.
Let's add this back extension, and then we'll add the face pull.
Let's say we want to make the face pull the first one.
You click on it, you hold it, you can move it up to the first one.
For this bicep curl, let's say we want to make a combo set with the face pull, you
dreop it on top of the face pull, now you have a combo set.
You want to add the back extension to the combo set, no problem.
Drop it anywhere here, it will be part of the combo set.
Drop it outside of it, and it will still be a standalone set.

# setup tab

If you want to, you can just design your program here and leave it at that.
But there's another tab, the setup tab which you may want to check out.
first of all you can have multiple profiles here for multiple people, or even for the same person over time.
For example, I actually create a new profile for myself every couple of months because my weight and body fat keeps going down.

Then you fill in all the values here. Some of these are not obvious and it is quite important to understand what these all mean,
so every value has a little info button, which provides a pop-up with in-depth information

So anyway, let's just say we are dealing with an advanced trainee who does three workouts
per week, energy balance, let's say he has a 10% calorie surplus.
for these other values you'll just need to read the documentation.
The important thing here is that you will have a base metabolic rate, and you can choose between
three different formulas, again, the formulas are explained in a little popup
This results in certain target calorie intake for your resting days, your training days, and
your average.
And then we also calculate your recommended intensities and your recommended workout volume.
the intensity ranges, these are percentage of 1RM.
Notice how now we have 65-85 here, so now those are your two options when you configure your sets for an exercise, but you can override
all these values, like for example, let's overide to 70, 80, and 90, and then those will be the values
that you can choose when configuring sets in the workout.
But I'm actually not super happy with how the system works right now, it will probably change.

We also computed the recommended number of sets per muscle per week.
If you start changing these things, for example, if you go into a cut, that volume will go down.
If you are a female, that volume will go up.
Based on all of these parameters, this value will change.
Of course, you can change it to whatever you like.
You can just say, ignore this, I want 10 sets of every muscle group per week.
And by the way, this includes your direct quote-unquote volume as well as your indirect
volume like we said before, which is why these numbers may seem high at first.
You can also do muscle-specific overrides.
So for example, let's say you have 10 per muscle group, but you want 15 for biceps.
Or you want abs, you want only 8, or whatever.
These targets will actually be used here.
So let's maybe go back to the demo program.
So here we actually compare all the volumes in the program with what's configured. 
All of them are red right now, cause the program doesn't meet the required volume, except for triceps where we have enough.
You don't need to obsess too much over these numbers, but it can be helpful to think through your desired volumes for all your muscles and then confirm that your program matches accordingly.

And it's fine and expected even that some of these will be fairly low,
like it's pretty common for the hamstring short head or the tricep long head to have a lower volume, or maybe the soleus.

## equipment 
And then finally, we have the equipment here at the bottom.
So by default, everything's enabled.
There's a couple of presets, like basic gym stuff, no equipment whatsoever.
So obviously, you can just kind of click and unclick things.
And then the only thing this really affects is the exercise selection.
So if you mark that you don't have certain equipment available, then when you go and add
a set and you look for an exercise here, then those exercises will not show up, obviously.
So that's just a little helper.

Oh just one last thing. Here at the bottom there's a program breakdown.
This is very much a work in progress, but this basically analyzes your program and verifies that you train
your muscles at different muscle lengths and in different movements.  This is more for advanced body builders,
they need to carefully select exercises that are complimentary to fully train each muscle.  Anyway, it's a work in progress.

## end 
And that's it really.  That's in a nutshell how body.build works.
I'm always adding more stuff.
Now you get the gist of how the application works, I hope.
So you can use this to compute some parameters and define your programs.
I have a lot more planned, to help you when you're at the gym, to follow your program, look up cues, track your statistics, tools to further adjust your program based on your observed performance, and so on.

All of that is coming.
For now you can just build and modify your program and the rest will come later.

I hope this was a useful introduction and that you understand the application better and what I'm trying to achieve.
Please let me know what you think.  I'm really curious for your feedback.
You can leave a comment on youtube, or go to the homepage. From here you can find our discord, email, and twitter. 
Thanks.
