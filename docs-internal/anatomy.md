# Anatomy (articulations and muscles)

Based on the information from the PTC anatomy module, some interpretation, and other sources.

You can look up:
* muscle's common functions and other details (e.g. insufficiency)
* joint articulations & involved muscles.

What I would really like to do is make this more visual.  
Such that you can see the entire ROM (range of motion) of a movement and see how different muscles/heads/fibers activate,  
become stronger at specific points (or have a better moment arm), when they are fully stretched, and deactivate

The best example of my current progress would be the **shoulder flexion**.  
To see it, hit the "articulations" button, and then click on "shoulder flexion".

### DISCLAIMER:
* use any information here at your own risk
* the **information is incomplete**, i need to add more data.
