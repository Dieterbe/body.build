when re-hitting same muscles:
    for strength, need full ATP-CP recovery (esp for high intensity training), which takes about 3 min, especially in trained
    for hypertrophy, it's volume that counts. need >1 min to keep work capacity/volume up
but antagonist supersets allow cutting rest
* women recover faster than men, and need less rest time between sets (and between workouts)
* intensity:
  - 90-100% RM low work output&fatigue recovers fairly fast
  - high intensity in general: ATP-CP crucial, needs more time
  - low intensity: larger glycolitic & aerobic component
* strength: more strength, reduces work capacity, needs more rest
* sets later in workout need more rest


in practice:
- just rest until you feel recovered enough for next max effort set
- if you don't feel it, >2min for isolation, >3min for compound
- heart rate not so relevant
- when time is limited:
    - mental recovery can take longer, or due to motivation. when time is limited, program fixed intervals.
    - don't rest until you feel "fully" recovered, so you have more time for more sets. do as many as possible. program optimistically. 1-2 min should do.
    - If you don't get enough sets done, see if you can cut rest and program fixed number of sets.
    - can progressively move from 2min down to 30s to train your work capacity
- in between sets: very light active recovery. e..g walking, or something light that stimulates blood flow in the trained muscle group, e.g. arm swings, foam rolling

ordering:
- priority exercises first. real priority for underdeveloped muscles, because may impact total muscle growth
- compounds before isolations to avoid weak links, and because better strength early on in workout (for same muscles, but also for non-overlapping muscles)
- big muscles before smaller ones due to difficulty recruiting
- (challenging -e.g. squats - before less challenging, but that follows logically from the above)
- high intensity before low intensity (happens anyway if you put compounds first)
- implement antagonist supersets when possible
    - chest before rows, hammies before quads
    - saves a lot of time, if you can do them. minimal rest in between, works best with explosive concentrics
    - but not just that, can typically do *more* work with the 2nd exercise
    - goal is more volume (more reps), but may reduce work capacity. can rest a bit between them
- use combo sets. like circuit training or (mini-)circruits of non overlapping muscles, but with minimal rest (30-60s)
    - significant cuts back on time spent, without much to loose
    - scales up to whole workout in 1 combo-set
    - allows to give focus to many muscle groups
    - more rest before hitting same muscle group again
    - bit more cardio intense too
