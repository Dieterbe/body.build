# Body.build

Hello there! This is the source code for https://body.build
The goal is to put the world's cutting edge knowledge around nutrition, health and weight lifting wisdom in one app, as a free, public service to anyone.
We have to start small, however, so for now it is simply a tool that helps coaches and advanced trainees with defining
a workout program and macros.  In the future, I'ld like to add a nutrition/meal planner, as well as an app that helps people in the gym to track their progress, analyze their performance, adjust the program over time, etc.

To this end, I (Dieter) have concluded the [Menno Henselmans Personal Training Course](https://mennohenselmans.com/online-pt-course/), which is probably the top course in the industry, taught by one of the best, most evidence-driven body builders in the world.

There is also another related project with similar goals, [wger](https://wger.de), to which I contribute. I think it is a good tool for nutrition/diet tracking, but the workout component is held back by legacy code and concepts.  However we are collaborating to see how well we can align.  For now, I mainly recommend wger for its nutrition module.
