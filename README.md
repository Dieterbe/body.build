# Body.build

Hello there! This is the source code for [body.build](https://body.build)

Goals:

* put the world's cutting edge knowledge around nutrition, health and weight lifting wisdom into a free, public set of applications and tools.
* Be state-of-the art (the most advanced), mainly cater to coaches and lifters who seek ultimate performance.

Currently implemented:

* [exercise library](https://body.build/app/exercises)
* [program maker](https://body.build/app/programmer)
* anatomy module for [muscles](https://body.build/app/muscles) and [joint articulations](https://body.build/app/articulations)

In the works:

* in-the-gym performance tracker and guide
* analytics on your personal data and program adjustments

Future roadmap:

* Make it more accessible to beginners .
* Nutrition/meal planner

To this end, I (Dieter) have concluded the [Menno Henselmans Personal Training Course](https://mennohenselmans.com/online-pt-course/), which is probably the top course in the industry, taught by one of the best, most evidence-driven body builders in the world.

This project is Open Source software, distributed under the [AGPL-3.0 license](LICENSE).  It is written in Flutter (dart), even if GitHub thinks it's javascript (that's just the compiled build for web)
