MPS:
Trained individuals generally have an anabolic window that peaks within 24 hours.
-> consume a disproportionate amount of their daily protein requirement in the period between the workout and bedtime. Itâ€™s likely advisable to have at least 2 meals during this period, or else to have an early meal the next day. mostly so when bulking, less important during cut/maintenance

 Your workouts should be surrounded by 2 meals with no more than 5 hours in between them and together those meals should have at least 0.8 g/kg protein, based on the research in bodybuilders from Mori and Cribb & Hayes. In the period between the workout and bedtime, you should consume at least 0.9 g/kg protein, generally over half your daily requirements. Your last meal of the day may benefit from a higher protein intake in particular, especially if you have a long fast afterwards. Do not restrict your thinking merely into training vs. rest days, however, as the anabolic window can easily span across calendar days.


 calorie cycling probably best for most.
