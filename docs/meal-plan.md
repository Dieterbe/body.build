Protein synching:
- mainly for trained individuals, and mainly when bulking. in other cases, less important. and even so, any synching not a major effect

MPS:
Trained individuals generally have an anabolic window that peaks within 24 hours.
-> consume a disproportionate amount of their daily protein requirement in the period between the workout and bedtime. It’s likely advisable to have at least 2 meals during this period, or else to have an early meal the next day. mostly so when bulking, less important during cut/maintenance

 Your workouts should be surrounded by 2 meals with no more than 5 hours in between them and together those meals should have at least 0.8 g/kg protein, based on the research in bodybuilders from Mori and Cribb & Hayes. In the period between the workout and bedtime, you should consume at least 0.9 g/kg protein, generally over half your daily requirements. Your last meal of the day may benefit from a higher protein intake in particular, especially if you have a long fast afterwards. Do not restrict your thinking merely into training vs. rest days, however, as the anabolic window can easily span across calendar days.


 calorie cycling probably best for most.
 PSMF, specifically for overweight individuals. (too aggressive for leaner individuals)
 kcal min 9.7*protein per day



 // dieter notes on 12 dec
 last meal of the day coud use a bit more protein, but typically already done

practically:
in anabolic window, muscle-full ceiling goes from roughly 20 to 40 g of protein, though diminishing returns
meals within the peak of the anabolic window should have a protein intake up to twice as high as meals outside of the anabolic window. Meals outside the anabolic window generally needn’t be larger than 0.4 g/kg, whereas those within it may benefit from going up to 0.6 g/kg or even 0.8 g/kg if it’s the last meal of the day and we really want to maximize the duration of MPS stimulation and MPB suppression


calorie cycling with PSMF is at worst, equally good as isocaliric, at best, better.

// dieter other notes:
protein: need 1.6 or 1.8 or 2.2 per day. use minima per meal, and ratios based on PSMF
fats: we need our 20-40% per day. can either be 0 fats outside of anabolic window, or everything pro-rata
per course: you can generally set protein, fat and fiber intakes as minima rather than set targets
