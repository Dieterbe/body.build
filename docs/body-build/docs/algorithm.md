high level algorithm to desining an optimal training program for max muscle growth

### step 1: measure or estimate 1RM

using Epley/Welday formula: Epley estimated 1RM = weight × (1 + repetitions / 30)

### step 2: determine intensity: percentage of 1RM
    hypertrophy: reps 5-30, which tends to be around. 30-85% (assuming close to failure) (6-12 reps is a brosience myth)
    low rep: train for 1RM strength & isometric strength, high rep: train for endurance strength (once you are > beginner), more fatigue // only relevant for trained people
    `>70%1RM -> tendon stronger, injury risk <->low rep, joint sparing, injury accommodating`
    do both high rep and low rep for more gains. either same workout, or other workouts
    untrained: no need for high&low. little gain >60%, -> 60%
    >novice: high&low, 70%, let's say 60 to 70%
    intermediate: 65-80
    advanced: high&low, --> 70 - 85-90% 
    
high intensity better suited for compound/multi-joint due to cardio/fatigue
low intensity for isolation for injury/technique

advanced techniques for later: couple of weeks strength focused, then lower intensity -> bigger overall gains

* prefer to spread sessions over the week, to reduce fatigue and support more volume.
* prefer to spread out volume in multiple high-frequency sessions, improves recovery
* don't do a majority of high rep sets in a workout, as it's too fatigueing

### step 3: rep targets: maybe not really a step. could be part of the routine.
// given 1RM + desired intensity targets, use muscle-specific hypertrophy method (but that already requires a whole program) or lookup table to come up with rep targets

for women, use muscle-specific hypertrophy method because they can do more reps

### step 4: determine volume: number of sets per week per muscle group. see calculator

hypertrophy: positive growth up to at least 10 sets per week per muscle group, if not 20-30. but also possible reduction of results starting at 20.
strength: tapers off well before 10 sets per week per exercise, but not much data, hence probably need different exercises
Based on all the evidence we have (very much "averaged data" for "most people"): optimal training volume is somewhere in the range of 10 to 20 sets per muscle group per week.  (based on recovery, as per formula)

elderly -> should be less
we assume rest intervals and training frequency is in line with the course recommendations. If that’s not the case, you’ll have to adjust it accordingly

for women menstruating:
do more volume in follicular phase, and less in luteal phase. e.g. +- 33%
(adjust volume over time, via AVT or tracking work capacity)

### step 5: training frequency

##### maintenance of strength and mass:
for novice lifters a single hard set per muscle per week.
for most lifters, single full-body workout per week.
advanced lifters need multiple sets per muscle per week.

(this probably assumes maintenance intake, but i'm not sure)

When performed to momentary muscle failure, this can even stimulate a bit of muscle growth

##### MEV (minimum effective volume to make long-term progress):
- for advanced lifters likely >3 sets per week per muscle group (very high effort, e.g. to failure)

The exact minimum effective volume is individual just like the optimum training volume. Certainly not everyone will be able to maximize their muscle growth on low-volume training


##### optimal training volume

productive training volume limited to 6-10 sets per muscle group per workout. (depends on program design, e.g. closeness to failure, rest intervals and individual factors like genetics)

in a video menno says no higher than 6 per muscle group per workout, even for advanced.

(Dieter note: for advanced trainees, increases up to daily or even bidaily training)

quotes from  [Menno Henselmans PT course](https://mennohenselmans.com/online-pt-course/).


> Benefits of higher training frequencies are found mostly in more advanced trainees on higher training volumes. In untrained individuals, there are only a few studies finding significant benefits of training a muscle more than once per week and none found improved muscle growth. In trained individuals, there are several studies finding significant benefits of training a muscle more than twice per week. The highest beneficial training frequencies are all found in advanced lifters on high training volumes. This trend aligns with the theory that as you get more advanced, your anabolic window shortens, there is less protein breakdown during training and you become more resistant to muscle damage and neuromuscular fatigue. Trained muscles may therefore benefit from a higher total training load and frequency of exercise

> Another large practical benefit of higher training frequencies and full-body workouts is that they can save you a ton of time, because they allow you to train non-overlapping muscle groups while other muscles are resting. We’ll cover this in greater detail in the module on exercise ordering

re: injury
When the primary goal is muscle growth, best stick to max 2x/week per exercise.
For higher frequency per muscle, use different exercises.

### step 6: split

once you figure out training frequency as in:
* frequency of working out
* frequency of training each muscle
* frequency of performing each exercise

-> this determines your training split

* if unequal numbers of rest days in your training split -> most strenuous workouts before those rest days
* if you have an easier workout -> most important workouts (with priority exercises/muscles) after the easier workout
* to maximize whole-body muscular development, spread sessions across the week as equally as possible.
