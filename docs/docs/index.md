# Welcome to body.build

Body.build is the world's most advanced weight lifting application for advanced lifters.  The goal is to make something free and open to everyone, no strings attached; to achieve something like WikiPedia for weight lifting, but *personalized* and *actionable*.

I took the [Menno Henselmans Personal Training Course](https://mennohenselmans.com/online-pt-course/) - the most in-depth science-based personal trainer course in the world - and graduated *Magna cum laude* in 2025. Now I want to share this knowledge with everyone through an awesome, free tool.
