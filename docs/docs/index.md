# Welcome to body.build

Body.build is the world's most advanced, evidence-based weight lifting program builder.  Completely free and open to everyone - no strings attached.  Well, that's the ambition anyway.  To achieve something like WikiPedia for weight lifting, but *personalized* and *actionable*.

I took the most intense education program for sports science / personal training that I could find - the Menno Henselmans training course - so that I could build this tool for you.

Right now it's still an early version focused on exploring exercises and constructing a program.  90% of weight lifting progress is about putting in the effort at the gym, tracking progress and making small program adjustments over time.  But we have to start somewhere!

I took the [Menno Henselmans Personal Training Course](https://mennohenselmans.com/online-pt-course/) — the most in-depth science-based personal trainer course in the world — and graduated *Magna cum laude* in 2025. Now I want to share this knowledge with everyone through an awesome, free tool.

> **Note:** This is still an early version focused on exploring exercises and constructing programs. 90% of weight lifting progress comes from consistent effort at the gym, tracking progress, and making small adjustments over time. But we have to start somewhere!
