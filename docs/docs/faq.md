# Frequently asked questions

## The volume calculations doesn't make sense / doesn't match what other programs or apps say.

There could be a few reasons for this:

* many apps and programs only consider "direct" volume - exercises with a given muscle as its main target (e.g. biceps during bicep curls), and ignore indirect volume (e.g. biceps during chin-ups)
  In line with research demonstrating that both types of volume "count", body.build considers both (though care must be taken to have a well balanced program), and therefore the numbers are often higher
* the calculations for optimal volume consider many factors, such as sex (females can handle more volume), sleep quality, energy balance (cutting vs bulking), etc.  They have been demonstrated successfully on hundreds of (highly motivated) under the guidance of good coaches, but consider them as a starting point.  People who don't want to push themselves too hard can certainly reduce the volume and still get great outcomes.
