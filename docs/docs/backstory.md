# The Story Behind body.build

Hello!  My name is Dieter.
As a professional software engineer and amateur weight lifter, I found a lot left to be desired in the fitness space.

* too many generic programs that don't fit well to individuals goals and muscle-specific needs (e.g. if you practice other sports)
* based on outdated/wrong ideas (e.g. the hypertrophy zone, "functional" training)
* if you want to learn, you have to piece together a lot of small bits of information that you can find online (e.g. in social media content or scientific articles)
* many apps and content creators provide the same information, over and over again.  It's incredibly redundant, and sometimes wrong or misleading.
* many apps are overly restrictive and lock up your information.

Therefore, my idea was to was to:
* go through the most in-depth education program for sports science / personal training that I could find.
* make a new type of application that solves the above problems, and make it freely available

I participated in the [Menno Henselmans personal training course](https://www.mennohenselmans.com/online-pt-course),
this course was incredibly comprehensive, globally recognized to be world class, and is based on the latest science.
I graduated *magna cum laude* in 2025 as a personal trainer.  

Since then, I started working on body.build 
It is still early days, and I am therefore focusing on the aspects around building workout programs.
Long term, I'ld like to add a mobile app as well to track and manage workouts at the gym as well, and to aid with program tweaks over time.
Maybe one day I can achieve something like WikiPedia. A ubiquitous resource, free for all, providing *personalized* and *actionable* content and applications that assist anyone with getting fit.

Here is a picture of me and Menno:
