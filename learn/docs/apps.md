# Apps

## Using web *and* mobile

Body.build is available on multiple platforms.

You'll typically use both:
* the web application for calculating nutritional values, workout volumes, and creating programs.
* either of the mobile apps for daily use: tracking workouts, logging body weight, etc.  The Android and iOS (iPhone) apps are equivalent.

General things such as exploring exercises, variations, anatomy, etc. are available on all platforms.
Today, programs created on web are not yet available in the mobile app, but this is coming.
